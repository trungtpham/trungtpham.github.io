**Welcome!**

I was born on a tranquil rubber and coffee farm, surrounded by the awe-inspiring beauty of nature. My journey into the realm of science and technology began later in life, as I didn't have access to a computer and the internet until I reached the age of 20. Fueled by unwavering determination and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I set forth on a path of exploration and innovation.

Today, I take immense pride in my role as a Senior Scientist at NVIDIA, a renowned company celebrated for its state-of-the-art technology. My journey stands as a testament to the belief that hard work and self-confidence can lead to remarkable success, regardless of one's starting point.

My work at NVIDIA revolves around enabling vehicles to drive autonomously. Collaborating with a talented team of scientists and engineers, we are dedicated to pioneering and developing real-time machine learning models and algorithms for 4D visual perception, which aids in the advancement of self-driving technology.

Prior to my time at NVIDIA, I conducted research at the Australian Centre of Robotic Vision and earned my PhD in Computer Vision from the University of Adelaide in 2014. In 2013, I had the privilege of being one of 200 young researchers from around the world invited to a prestigious event known as the Heidelberg Laureate Forum. In 2012, Google recognized my contributions to computer vision with a special scholarship.

**Research Interests**

My researches range from low-level geometric vision (ie geometric fitting, 3D reconstruction, SLAM) to high-level semantic scene understanding (ie object detection, semantic segmentation). More recently, I am particularly interested in end-to-end 3D perception from multiple cameras. My favourite appplications include autonomous driving, indoor robotics. 

My research has been published across top-tier computer vision, machine learning and robotic journals and conferences (TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICRA), and has attracted more than 1000 citations (as of Dec 2020).
