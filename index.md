**Welcome!**

Iâ€™m a Principal Scientist at NVIDIA, driving research and productization of LLMs, VLMs, and VLAs to tackle real-world challenges in autonomous driving. My work focuses on BEV perception, online mapping, end-to-end self-driving models, and large-scale synthetic data generation, bridging cutting-edge AI with deployable vehicle systems.

I earned my PhD in Computer Vision at the University of Adelaide and conducted research at the Australian Centre of Robotic Vision. My contributions have been recognized with a Google Scholarship (2012) and an invitation to the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (2013).
