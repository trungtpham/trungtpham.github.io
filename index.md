**Welcome!**

I was born on a tranquil rubber and coffee farm in VietNam, surrounded by the awe-inspiring beauty of nature. My journey into the realm of science and technology began later in life, as I didn't have access to a computer and the internet until I reached the age of 20. Fueled by determination and a thirst for knowledge, I set forth on a path of exploration and innovation.

Today, I take immense pride in my role as a Principal Scientist at NVIDIA, a renowned company celebrated for its state-of-the-art technology. My journey stands as a testament to the belief that hard work and self-confidence can lead to remarkable success, regardless of one's starting point.

My work at NVIDIA revolves around enabling vehicles to drive autonomously. Collaborating with a talented team of scientists and engineers, we are dedicated to pioneering and developing real-time machine learning models and algorithms for 4D visual perception, which aids in the advancement of self-driving technology.

Prior to my time at NVIDIA, I conducted research at the Australian Centre of Robotic Vision and earned my PhD in Computer Vision from the University of Adelaide in 2014. In 2013, I had the privilege of being one of 200 young researchers from around the world invited to a prestigious event known as the Heidelberg Laureate Forum. In 2012, Google recognized my contributions to computer vision with a special scholarship.

**Research**

I engage in research within the domains of computer vision and machine learning. My work has been featured in prestigious journals and conferences in these fields, including TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, and ICRA. Notably, my research has garnered over 2000 citations as of December 2022, reflecting its significant impact in the academic community.

**Internship at NVIDIA**

If you possess a solid foundation in computer vision and machine learning and share a keen enthusiasm for tackling challenges in autonomous driving, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
